## I have created this Face Detection React App. Initially, you need to create an account, and then you will navigate to another page to detect a face from an image by entering the image URL. 
## For the frontend, I am utilizing the React library.For the backend, I've developed the server using NodeJS and ExpressJS.As for the database, I've employed PostgreSQL. Additionally, I'm utilizing the Clarifai API for face detection, which provides a face detection model!
